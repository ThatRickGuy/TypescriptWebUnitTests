This is a learning effort and I'm sure someone else has a better way of accomplishing this, 
but it is what I did to figure out how to write some typescript, use TSC to transpile to JS, 
and Browserify to get it run in a web browser. 

It also uses function decorators and a little reflection. So that was fun!
